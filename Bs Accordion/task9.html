				<p>Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. </p>
				<p>His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a </p>
				<p>reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray </p>
				<p>eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a </p>
				<p>natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training </p>
				<p>and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically</p>
				<p>fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his </p>
				<p>relatively baggy clothing.After the four-year time skip, Eren </p>
				<p>grew his hair down to his neck.</p>

				<p>Eren's appearance changes quite drastically when he transformed into the Attack Titan. 
				His height increased to 15 m, his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, and his tongue and ears became elongated. 
				His facial features also underwent a transformation; he developed a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes became deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, 
				jagged shape that was unsuited for intelligible speech.</p>

			<li>Gender: Male</li>
              <li>Height: 180 cm</li>

				<p>Dot Pixis was the Garrison's former Chief Official </p>
				<p>of the Southern Territories ( also translated as "Highest </p>
				<p>Ranking Commander of the Southern Territory"), </p>
				<p>which includes Trost District. He was often simply</p>
				</p>addressed as "commander". </p>
				<p>In matters of defense, he was given full authority.</p>

				<p> Pixis was a bald man with a structured build. </p>
				<p>He had a distinguished mustache, with light skin </p>
				<p>and notable wrinkles under his eyes. </p>
				<p>As a commander, he also wore a bolo tie,</p>
				<p>much like his fellow commanders Hange Zoë</p>
				<p>and Nile Dok. As a high ranking Garrison officer,</p>
				<p>he was only seen wearing his Garrison </p>
				<p>uniform paired with a white button-up shirt</p>
				<p>and a red sash with gold trim.</p>
				
				<p> Pixis was an eccentric man. While observing Titans breaching</p>
				<p>Wall Rose, he said that he would not mind being eaten by a </p>
				<p>Titan if "it happened to be a stunning beauty." He retained a</p>
				<p>calm, and light-hearted demeanor, even in the midst of chaos,</p>
				<p>and he understands the strife and suffering of others, </p>
				<p>as he was seen allowing soldiers who wanted to leave because </p>
				<p>he understood the extreme amounts of terror and fear in those soldiers.</p>
